# 👋 Hey, I’m Ayush!

I'm a **Data Engineer at HP Inc.**, focused on building intelligent, scalable data pipelines and exploring the intersection of **Data Science**, **Generative AI**, and **user behavior analytics** — especially within experimental domains like **e-commerce** and **real-time insights**.

My journey began with **mobile application development**, which gave me a strong foundation in building user-centric digital experiences. Over time, I transitioned into **AI/ML and data engineering**, where I now design data systems, deploy machine learning models, and experiment with GenAI applications that bridge business goals with smart automation.

---

## 💼 What I Do

- Build scalable data systems using **PySpark**, **SQL**, **Databricks**, and **Azure**
- Explore applications of **LLMs and Generative AI** in real-world use cases
- Consult stakeholders for a **scalable** and long term data system
- Develop custom dashboards and analytics solutions for internal and external stakeholders

---

## 🧠 Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Markdown, Dart  
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, PyTorch (basics), XGBoost  
- **Data Engineering**: Spark, Databricks, Delta Lake  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Azure, Docker, Git  
- **Visualization**: Excel, Matplotlib  
- **Extras**: Kaggle Competitor

## ⚽️ Outside Work

When I’m not coding or writing, I’m:
- Walking to hit my **10k steps/day goal**
- Nerding out over **football analytics**
- Watching European football (UCL, Bundesliga – let's talk tactics!)
